## 📋 Project Overview [[memory:4957087]]

This project is a comprehensive AI-powered sports talent assessment platform that uses computer vision and machine learning to evaluate athletic performance in real-time without requiring expensive equipment or physical testing facilities.

### 🎯 Problem Statement & Solution

**Problem:**
- Traditional sports talent identification requires expensive equipment and facilities
- Rural athletes lack access to proper assessment centers
- Manual evaluation is subjective and inconsistent
- Limited reach of talent scouts in remote areas

**Our Solution:**
A complete digital platform that uses just a smartphone/laptop camera to:
- Assess athletic performance across multiple sports
- Provide real-time feedback and coaching
- Detect cheating and form violations
- Predict Olympic potential and talent levels
- Support multiple languages for accessibility
